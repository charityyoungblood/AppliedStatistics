<!-- Models: What are they used for, What issues are involved? --> 

Models are used to "predict" a feature from a joint relationship between features 

For example, when looking at Sales, vs. TV, Radio, and Newspaper - what is the relationship between the three? 
  - In this example, "Sales" is the RESPONSE or TARGET VARIABLE that we wish to predict 
  - Generally, you refer to the RESPONSE variable as "Y" 
  - "TV, Radio, and Newspaper" are all FEATURE/INPUT/PREDICTOR VARIABLES
